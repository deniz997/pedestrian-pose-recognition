## Information about OpenPose Input

The JSON input files that are used to train this model will be generated with OpenPose. However, since OpenPose is a very large project, we will **NOT** upload its source to this repository. But the complete system will rely on an installed OpenPose application.

With existing JSON files that are already computed by OpenPose, this model should be able to train on it's own. The only restriction then will be, that no real-time application can be done.
